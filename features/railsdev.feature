As a Rails Developer
I want spend less time setting up my laptop
In order to spend more time writing cool software in rails

Given that I enable the rails profile
And that I enable the sublime option
# And that I enable the emacs option
When run chef-solo
Then my XPS13 will have sublime and rails w ruby 1.9
And Life will be awesome
